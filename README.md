This is a project about Linear Regression conducted on the "Regression with Abalone Dataset" from kaggle.com by Gladys Murage.
The purpose of this model was two fold: first, as a class assignment in my Data Science PHD class DDS 8555v1 ( Predictive Analysis at National University, San Diego), and secondly to compete in the Kaggle competition(late submission).
The traget feature was the number of Rings on the Abalone. The measure used to assess the model is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).
The RMSLE obtained was not very robust with Linear Regression which necessitates me to switch models and build two other models a Random Forest regression versus an XG Boost to improve the RMSLE.
The latter are found in a different repository named Abalone- Random forest versus XG Boost regression.
